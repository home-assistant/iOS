Welcome to Home Assistant Companion version 2019.1, also known as 2.0! It's been a very long time coming but it's finally here. Here's some of the new features in this release:

- Brand new push notification engine, powered by Firebase, for even more complex notifications than ever before, including critical notifications and much much more
- Siri Shortcuts: Now, you can interact with your Home Assistant via Siri and the Shortcuts app
- Apple Watch: Control your home via the Apple Watch app and monitor its status with Complications
- Widget: Quickly trigger actions at home via a widget. Also available via home screen icon
- Nabu Casa Cloud support: Cloudhooks and remote UI are here so you can (optionally) never open a port in your router again
- New connection engine: now you can have internal and external URLs for total customizability

There's plenty more new features and improvements to discover instead. Check the forums and the new documentation for more information.

Thanks for using Home Assistant Companion!
