Another week, another new Home Assistant for iOS build!

- More localization support! We now support Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Dutch and Spanish. Minor updates were also made to the existing German translation.
- Add support for granular control of location update triggers (in Settings->Location)
- Support customization of notification display options (see online docs for this, but allows you to specify badge/alert/sound or any combination of the three for each notification)
- Add ability to send URL in push notification which opens upon tap
- Add confirmation dialogs when opening a homeassistant:// URL
- Re-enable Fabric so I can start tracking crashes again
- Improve notification permission check
- Lots of other localization work
- Bug fixes

Please submit a rating if you haven't already, it's my fuel that keeps me going!
